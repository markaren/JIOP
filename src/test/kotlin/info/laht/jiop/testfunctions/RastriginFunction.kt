/**
 * In mathematical optimization, the Rastrigin function is a non-convex function used
 * as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms.
 * It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function.
 * It was first proposed by Rastrigin as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by MÃ¼hlenbein et al.
 * Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima.
